# IsoBlocks
 This is a clone of the Pebble watch clock face IsoTime, written for the Fitbit Ionic.

This was written to see what it would take to recreate the Pebble's IsoTime clock 
face from scratch and what that code could look like.

Writer of the current clone in this repository: Aaron Waruszewski
Original creator of IsoTime is Chris Lewis https://github.com/C-D-Lewis
